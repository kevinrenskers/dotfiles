# Mac OS X setup

This is a list of reproducible steps to get a clean Mac up and running with nice dotfiles for Bash and ZSH, plus a whole bunch of apps and development tools. Tested on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and 10.10 (Yosemite).

## Step 1: prepare Mac OS X

1. Install Xcode from the App Store
2. Open Xcode's preferences and install the command line tools package (this will also install Git) (on OS X Mavericks you need to run `xcode-select --install` instead)
3. Install http://www.starryhope.com/keyfixer/ *(optional)*


## Step 2: install Homebrew

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

To update Homebrew itself:

    $ brew update
    
Very handy first installs:

    $ brew install trash && alias rm='trash'
    $ brew cask install qlstephen
    
To update all installed packages:

    $ brew upgrade


## Step 3: dotfiles

### 3a: install dotfiles dependencies

#### For Bash

    $ brew install bash-completion

#### For ZSH

I'm using oh-my-zsh with the [agnoster theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes).

    $ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"


### 3b: install the dotfiles

    $ git clone https://github.com/kevinrenskers/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
    
### 3c: set your default shell

    $ chsh -s /bin/zsh

**Restart your shell after it's done.** Read the `INSTALL.md` file for more detailed instructions and tips.

On a fresh Mac you might want to run `$ . .osx` to setup some sensible defaults.


### Step 3c: setup iTerm2 for ZSH
If you're using ZSH and the included `.zshrc` file, you need to configure iTerm2 (or the standard Terminal.app) to work with the agnoster theme.

1. install and use the [Solarized Dark colorscheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
2. use the [Menlo-Powerline font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) (note: already automatically installed to your system in step 3b)


## Step 4: native apps
Installing native (non-Mac App Store) apps using Homebrew.

If you're not using my dotfiles or didn't restart your terminal session yet, you probably want to run this command first:

    export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=/Applications"

Then to install the apps into /Applications:

    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install dropbox
    $ brew cask install one-password
    $ brew cask install iterm2


## Step 5: anything else you need

### Python
I'm using [Homebrew's Python](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-and-Python) because it's newer and comes with pip and setuptools.

    $ brew install python giflib jpeg
    $ pip install wheel virtualenvwrapper PIL

Upgrade pip itself:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip

To upgrade setuptools, which is used by pip:

    $ pip install --upgrade setuptools

*note: ZSH trying to correct `pip` to `.pip` for you? Run `hash -rf` to fix this.*
    
    
### Ruby, RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and RubyGems

    $ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
    
Ignore the instructions to insert the rvm script into your bash profile - if you installed my dotfiles, that's already included.
    
**Restart your shell after it's done** and test with `ruby --version`, it should have installed version 2.x. If you want to stay on Ruby 1.9.3, run these commands after restarting your shell:

    $ rvm install 1.9.3
    $ rvm --default use 1.9.3

Once RVM is installed you can install your favorite packages:

    $ gem install cocoapods
    $ gem install rails

To update RVM itself:

    $ rvm get stable

To update RubyGems itself:

    $ gem update --system


### PostgreSQL

    $ brew install postgresql
    $ initdb /usr/local/var/postgres
    $ cp /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.2.4/org.postgresql.postgres.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    $ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.postgresql.postgres.plist

To use with Python:

    $ export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
    $ export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
    $ sudo pip install psycopg2

Or simply download Postgress.app from http://postgresapp.com.


### MySQL

    $ brew install mysql
    $ brew services start mysql
    $ mysql_secure_installation
    
To use with Python:

    $ sudo pip install mysql-python
    
Manually Starting and stopping the server:

    $ mysql.server start
    $ mysql.server start


### Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager)

    $ brew install node

Once this is installed you can install your favorite packages:

    $ npm install -g coffee-script
    $ npm install less --save
    
To update NPM:

    $ npm install npm -g


### Nginx

    $ brew install nginx
    $ sudo ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist /Library/LaunchAgents
    $ sudo mkdir /var/log/nginx/

Edit `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, change port to 80 and error_log to `/var/log/nginx/error.log`. Then start the server:

    $ sudo nginx

Config file:

    /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Other commands:

    $ sudo nginx -s stop
    $ sudo nginx -s reload

### PHP-FPM

    $ brew tap josegonzalez/homebrew-php
    $ brew tap homebrew/dupes
    $ brew install php55 --with-mysql --with-fpm
    $ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/php55/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    $ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php55.plist

Example Nginx config (place in `server` directive):

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_index  index.php;
        include        fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }

Config files:

    /usr/local/etc/php/5.5/php-fpm.conf
    /usr/local/etc/php/5.5/php.ini

Starting and stopping the server:

    $ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php55.plist
    $ launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php55.plist


### LaunchRocket
[LaunchRocket](https://github.com/jimbojsb/launchrocket) is a Mac PreferencePane for managing services with launchd. It's pretty handy for MySQL, PHP-FPM, Nginx, etc.

    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install launchrocket
